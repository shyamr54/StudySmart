- Hacking is the act of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access.
- Types of Hacking:
  - White Hat Hacking (Ethical Hacking): Conducted by security professionals with permission to find and fix vulnerabilities.
  - Black Hat Hacking: Done with malicious intent to steal data, install malware, or damage systems.
  - Grey Hat Hacking: Falls between white and black hat; the hacker may not have malicious intent but still breaks laws or violates ethics.
